It's a NewsExplorer Web

First of all, let me give a brief introduction for my work. This is a News Explorer webapp which could be used among different resolutions of devices. In this app, it was connected to the external API sources, users then could search all kind of tech news based on their needs through this app.

In this app, it has the 4 main sections, they are the header, main, about author, and the footer sections respectively. In the header, it has the logo, home link, saved-articles link, and sign in bar. In which the logo is unclickable, but other elements will be able to navigate you to the specific page as its name stands.

In the main section, it has the searching bar for you to input your searching keywords out there. Once you input a valid keyword, the preloaded section will pop out and show you that your news is loading; otherwise, it will tell you that your news unfound; If the news you are searching are found, then the news section will display with 3 news cards there. If you want to see more news shows there, you then need to click the button: "Show more". In this app, the maximum showing news we set here are 6 news. In this news, if you have some favorite news, then you can click the save-icon on each of the news card to save them for re-read it later on by the saved-article's page.

In the About author section, it has the developers' avatar and basic career intro.

Lastly, it's the footer section. In this section, we integrated the 2 popular social media links and my bootcamp link, it will bring the easiest access for people to explore their needs on this web app.
